## Notes:
1. The "feature_extraction_tools" folder contains two .py files on EMG feature extraction to perform feature extraction on EMG data for use as input to shallow machine learning classifiers.
2. The "processing_tools" folder contains four .py files for EMG denoising and preprocessing.
3. The "pytorch_tools" folder contains a .py file for visualization and complexity calculation of deep learning models.
4. The "common_params.py" file is about some common parameter settings of the method proposed in this study, such as data preprocessing and feature extraction, dataset partitioning, model construction, training, and testing.
5. The "common_utils.py" file contains some common functions.
